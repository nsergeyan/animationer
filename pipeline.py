"""
Stage runner for the video pipeline.

One folder per video under output/<slug>/. You paste Claude's JSON into
script.json, then run the stages in order. Every stage reads files and writes
files - nothing is carried in memory between them - so any stage can be re-run
on its own without redoing the ones before it.

NORMAL USE - paste and run:

    1. Fill in TOPIC / FORMAT / BEATS at the top of prompts/manualprompt.txt
       and paste that whole file into Claude with web search on.
    2. Paste the JSON it returns into NEW_SCRIPT below.
    3. Run this file. It makes the run folder itself and does everything.

That last command runs every stage in order. A Chrome window appears during
the image stage and drives itself; leave it alone and it closes when done.
Safe to re-run - finished work is skipped, so an interrupted run resumes.

Individual stages, for when you want to redo just one thing:

    python pipeline.py prompts                # script.json -> scenes.txt
    python pipeline.py images                 # opens Flow, fills images/
    python pipeline.py voice                  # ElevenLabs -> audio/
    python pipeline.py manifest               # pairs it all up + durations
    python pipeline.py music                  # compose this video's own bed
    python pipeline.py render                 # Remotion -> final.mp4

    python pipeline.py check                  # what is done, what is missing
    python pipeline.py demo                   # fake a whole run, no APIs

Every command takes --run <slug>. Without it the most recently touched run is
used, which is almost always the one you mean.
